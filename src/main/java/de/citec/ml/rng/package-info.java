/**
 * This is an implementation of the Neural Gas algorithm on
 * distance data (Relational Neural Gas) for unsupervised clustering.
 *
 * We recommend that you use the functions provided by the RelationalNeuralGas
 * class for your purposes. All other classes and functions are utilities which
 * are used by this central class. In particular, you can use RelationalNeuralGas.train()
 * to obtain a RNGModel (i.e. a clustering of your data), and subsequently
 * you can use RelationalNeuralGas.getAssignments() to obtain the resulting
 * cluster assignments, and RelationalNeuralGas.classify() to cluster new points
 * which are not part of the training data set.
 *
 * The underlying scientific work is summarized nicely in the dissertation
 * "Topographic Mapping of Dissimilarity Datasets" by Alexander Hasenfuss
 * (2009).
 *
 * The basic properties of an Relational Neural Gas algorithm are the following:
 * 1.) It is relational: The data is represented only in terms of a pairwise
 * distance matrix.
 * 2.) It is a clustering method: The algorithm provides a clustering model,
 * that is: After calculation,
 * each data point should be assigned to a cluster (for this package here we
 * only consider hard clustering, that is: each data point is assigned to
 * exactly one cluster).
 * 3.) It is a vector quantization method: Each cluster corresponds to a
 * prototype, which is in the center of the
 * cluster and data points are assigned to the cluster if and only if they are
 * closest to this particular prototype.
 * 4.) It is rank-based: The updates of the prototypes depend only on
 * the distance ranking, not on the absolute value of the distances.
